# Crime Prediction and Prevention in Canada
*A Decision Intelligence Approach to Understanding Nationwide Crime Trends*

## Problem Context
Crime remains a persistent challenge in Canada, affecting public safety, economic stability, and social well-being. While national crime rates have fluctuated over the years, some regions continue to experience rising incidents of violent crime, property offenses, and cybercrime <mark>(cite)</mark>. Law enforcement agencies and policymakers need data-driven insights to predict crime patterns, allocate resources effectively, and implement proactive prevention strategies.

The integration of **decision intelligence tools**—such as predictive analytics, machine learning, and geospatial mapping—can significantly enhance crime prevention efforts. By analyzing nationwide crime trends across all provinces, this project aims to provide a **data-driven approach to crime prediction and prevention**, supporting Sustainable Development Goal 16 (SDG 16): *Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions*.

## Significance of the Study
This project is crucial for multiple reasons:

1. **Rising Crime Trends:** Certain crimes, such as cybercrime and fraud, have increased in Canada <mark>(cite)</mark>. Understanding patterns can help law enforcement take proactive measures.
2. **Resource Allocation:** Police and security agencies must distribute resources efficiently to areas with higher crime rates.
3. **Community Safety:** Identifying high-risk areas allows policymakers to implement crime-reduction programs.
4. **Data-Driven Decision-Making:** Advanced analytics can improve crime forecasting and intervention strategies.
5. **SDG 16 Alignment:** This project contributes to global efforts for peace and justice by ensuring safer communities.

## Research Objectives
The primary objectives of this study are:
- **Analyze nationwide crime patterns** using historical data from all Canadian provinces.
- **Identify crime hotspots** and trends over time.
- **Develop predictive models** to forecast future crime rates.
- **Provide actionable recommendations** for law enforcement and policymakers.

## Potential Datasets
To conduct this study, the following open datasets will be utilized:

1. **Statistics Canada - Crime Severity Index (CSI)**
   - Source: [https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/type/data](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/type/data)
   - <mark>be more specific with the URL : https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3510002601</mark>
   - Contents: National and provincial crime rates, crime severity index, violent and non-violent crime data.
   - Temporal coverage: 1998 - Present
   - Geographic scope: Canada (all provinces and territories)
   - <mark>Frequency - yearly?</mark>

2. **Police-Reported Crime Statistics**
   - Source: [https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset)
   - Contents: Crime incidents reported by law enforcement agencies.

   - Geographic scope: Canada-wide statistics

## Conclusion
By leveraging open data sources and advanced decision intelligence tools, this project will contribute to a better understanding of crime trends in Canada. The findings will support law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and communities in implementing effective crime prevention strategies, ultimately fostering a safer and more just society.
