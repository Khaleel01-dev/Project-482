# Crime Prediction and Prevention in Canada  
## A Decision Intelligence Approach to Understanding Nationwide Crime Trends  

## Problem Context  
Crime remains a persistent challenge in Canada, affecting public safety, economic stability, and social well-being. While national crime rates have fluctuated over the years, some regions continue to experience rising incidents of violent crime, property offenses, and cybercrime ([Statistics Canada, 2023](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/type/data)). Law enforcement agencies and policymakers need data-driven insights to predict crime patterns, allocate resources effectively, and implement proactive prevention strategies.  

The integration of decision intelligence tools—such as predictive analytics, machine learning, and geospatial mapping—can significantly enhance crime prevention efforts. By analyzing nationwide crime trends across all provinces, this project aims to provide a data-driven approach to crime prediction and prevention, supporting Sustainable Development Goal 16 (SDG 16): **Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions**.  

## Significance of the Study  
This project is crucial for multiple reasons:  

- **Rising Crime Trends**: Certain crimes, such as cybercrime and fraud, have increased in Canada ([Statistics Canada, 2023](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/type/data)). Understanding patterns can help law enforcement take proactive measures.  
- **Resource Allocation**: Police and security agencies must distribute resources efficiently to areas with higher crime rates ([Public Safety Canada, 2022](https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/cntrng-crm/index-en.aspx)).  
- **Community Safety**: Identifying high-risk areas allows policymakers to implement crime-reduction programs ([RCMP, 2023](https://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/crime-prevention)).  
- **Data-Driven Decision-Making**: Advanced analytics can improve crime forecasting and intervention strategies ([Government of Canada, 2023](https://open.canada.ca/en)).  
- **SDG 16 Alignment**: This project contributes to global efforts for peace and justice by ensuring safer communities ([United Nations, 2023](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal16)).  

## Research Objectives  
The primary objectives of this study are:  

- Analyze nationwide crime patterns using historical data from all Canadian provinces.  
- Identify crime hotspots and trends over time.  
- Develop predictive models to forecast future crime rates.  
- Provide actionable recommendations for law enforcement and policymakers.
