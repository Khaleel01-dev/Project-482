# Nationwide Crime Prediction and Prevention in Canada  
**A Decision Intelligence Approach to Understanding SDG 16**

*By:Khaleel Mohammed*

## Executive Summary  
This project addresses the challenge of crime prevention and prediction in Canada through the lens of **Sustainable Development Goal 16: Peace, Justice & Strong Institutions**. By utilizing open crime data from various provinces and integrating decision intelligence tools such as Python and Tableau, we aim to predict crime trends, identify high-risk areas, and propose actionable interventions for improving public safety. Our analysis blends traditional statistical techniques with machine learning methods to forecast crime patterns, uncover correlations, and assess the effectiveness of potential crime prevention strategies.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Crime Prediction Accuracy (CPA)**
   - Percentage of correctly predicted crime incidents compared to actual data
   - Target: Achieve a prediction accuracy of 80% or higher
   - Baseline: Current predictive models show 65% accuracy in crime forecasting

2. **High-Risk Area Identification (HRAI)**
   - Number of areas identified as high-risk for crime based on ~~predictive~~ classification models
   - Target: Increase identification rate by 20% in urban centers
   - Measured quarterly with crime hotspots analysis <mark>is this a tool or dataset?  if so, cite it</mark>

3. **Crime Reduction Impact (CRI)**
   - Percentage reduction in crime rates following the implementation of predictive interventions
   - Target: Reduce crime by 10% in identified high-risk areas over 12 months
   - Quarterly monitoring and comparison with baseline crime statistics

4. **Community Safety Index (CSI)**
   - A composite index measuring public perception of safety and actual crime rates
   - Target: Achieve a CSI of 8/10 or higher in at least 50% of Canadian provinces
   - Measured bi-annually through surveys and crime data analysis

5. **Crime Prevention Efficiency Ratio (CPER)**
   - Ratio of crimes prevented through targeted interventions to total crimes in high-risk areas
   - Target: Prevent at least 15% of crimes annually using predictive models
   - Monthly monitoring in collaboration with law enforcement agencies
